"""Shared helper behind the "refresh" action of the scan task pages.

Both the RPM and the SRPM page re-read Jenkins for tasks that are already
registered in the portal but have not reached a terminal state yet. The
scan-specific parts are supplied by the caller: the ORM model, the column
that holds the state, the non-terminal states, and how to sync one task.
